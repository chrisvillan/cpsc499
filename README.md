What is a Musical Instrument Digital Interface and MIDI?
It’s an interface that can convert noise from an instrument into digital data. It captures numerous musical data such as tempo, tone, pitch, length, and more. 

Objective of Project: to capture MIDI notes and develop an algorithm that determines the mood of the song. 

What makes a song happy or sad?
There really isn’t a universal or standard rule that makes a song happy or sad. Since mood and how a song is interpreted can vary from one person to another. There are certain trends and theories that can help narrow it down. 

Music Notation
For the entire project, I’ll be strictly using Treble Clef notes which is a set of notes that range within a certain pitch. This range usually carries the melodies of most popular songs. The picture below shows musical notation on music sheets and will be referring to this notation often.
